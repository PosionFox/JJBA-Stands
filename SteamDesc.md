This is a mod that tries to incorporate the entities of JoJo's Bizarre Adventures known as "Stands" into Forager.

I highly suggest downloading Cave's Scrollable Structure List: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1985510486


[h1]How to get a Stand[/h1]
You can try any of the following options:
[list]
[*]Start a new game
[*]Craft a Suspicious arrow in a forge and use it
[*]Dig up(digging spot) and use a Holy part from the desert
[/list]


[h1]How to use your Stand[/h1]
You can summon or dismiss your Stand by pressing Q, some abilities can only be executed with your Stand being active and some others not.
The keybinds for using your Stand's abilities are: R, F, C and G; some Stands have abilities that can be performed by holding the respective ability keybind.
You can remap your keybinds with the jjRemapKeybind command, examples:
/jjRemapKeybind summon z (changes your summon keybind to z)
/jjRemapKeybind ability3 h (changes your third ability keybind to h)


[h1]How to get more Stands[/h1]
You can't own more than one Stand at a time, to get more Stands you first need to either find a rokakaka tree and chop it down(eat it's fruit, this will remove your Stand) or finish Pucci's first quest, he will rarely spawn at the center of the map, once you do so he will reward you with a blueprint for crafting empty Stand discs, these discs will remove and store your current Stand inside it allowing you to get new Stands. After using the disc blueprint Pucci will have a new quest available. Also, owning a WhiteSnake Stand allows you to generate your own empty discs.


[h1]How to evolve your Stand[/h1]
Some Stands are capable of evolving into a stronger form:
[list]
[*]Shadow The World can evolve into The World, The World Gray(uncommon), Spooky World(rare), The World Greatest High(legendary) or The World Runic(mythical) with enough experience gained
[*]Shadow can evolve into The World Retro
[*]Killer Queen can evolve into Killer Queen: Bites the Dust or Shadow Queen: Bites the Dust(epic) upon using a Requiem arrow
[*]Gold Experience can evolve into Requiem upon using a Requiem arrow
[*]Dirty Deeds Done Dirt Cheap can evolve into D4C: Love Train by collecting and using the missing Holy parts
[*]Patriot D4C can evolve into Patriot D4C: Love Train or Evergreen(ascended)
[*]Star Platinum can evolve into Star Platinum: The World with enough experience gained or Time Emperor(epic)
[*]The World can evolve into The World Over Heaven by using a DIO's diary(DIO drops it)
[/list]


[h1]Fighting DIO[/h1]
DIO is a strong boss which can be fought by summoning him during night time using an egyptian crown, such item can be crafted in DIO's coffin, a new structure in the magic category, upon defeat, DIO will drop either a DIO's diary or a DIO's bone(does nothing at the moment), if DIO is not defeated before sunrise, he will despawn.


[h1]Upgrading your Stand[/h1]
With the Rune system you can upgrade your Stand or yourself by equipping runes in rune slots, you can equip a maximum of 3 runes at a time, runes can be obtained in a number of ways(currently only DIO drops runes) and provide certain effects like increasing your Stand damage or healing over time, if you feel like your Stand is too weak for some reason or you just don't have a mythic, you can equip runes and upgrade instantly.
